This repository demonstrates how to customize the end-of-line style in the Syncfusion WinForms EditControl. The EditControl is a powerful text editor component that supports syntax highlighting, code editing, and advanced customization options.

## Key Features Demonstrated in This Sample

    • Change the end-of-line marker style programmatically.
    • Apply custom colors and shapes to the marker.
